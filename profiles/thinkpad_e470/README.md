## About this config

* Focus on **shortcuts**
* High **usability** and **performance**
* **Optimized** for a 60% keyboard
* **Low resources** used
* **Colors and palette**: Mostly [Nord Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes)

## Why nord?

I'm using the [nord colorscheme](https://www.nordtheme.com/) because is a perfect balance between dark and light. Don't judge me I love dark themes, but there is something missing in using a total dark theme.
I remember when the first time I riced I spent over a month by changing the palette to find a list of colors that fits, thanks to [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/) that helped me a lot.
One day [one of my friend](https://github.com/w00zie) told me that he started using a colorscheme called nord and after some screenshot I decided to try it.
Now I'm using nord everywhere I can, from vim to firefox and I'm well settled.

## How I maintain those dotfiles

With [Daje](https://github.com/Wabri/Daje) of course. ***Actually daje development are in pause, so I manage by hands***
