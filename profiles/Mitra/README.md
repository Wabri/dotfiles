## Why nord?

I'm using the [nord colorscheme](https://www.nordtheme.com/) because is a perfect balance between dark and light. Don't judge me I love dark themes, but there is something missing in using a total dark theme.
I remember when the first time I riced I spent over a month by changing the palette to find a list of colors that fits, thanks to [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/) that helped me a lot.
One day [one of my friend](https://github.com/w00zie) told me that he started using a colorscheme called nord and after some screenshot I decided to try it.
Now I'm using nord everywhere I can, from vim to firefox and I'm well settled.
